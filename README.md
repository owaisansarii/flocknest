# Flocknest Backend

## Spring Boot Overview

Spring Boot is a framework designed for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications effortlessly. It simplifies setup, configuration, and execution of applications, including web apps. Spring Initializr helps generate project structures, while Maven serves as the chosen build tool. MongoDB integration is achieved by adding a dependency in the `pom.xml` file.

### Spring Initializr

Spring Initializr is a web tool aiding in generating initial project setups for Spring Boot applications. It streamlines development by providing necessary configurations and basic files.

### Maven as Build Tool

Maven is the chosen build tool for this project, managing dependencies, compiling code, and packaging artifacts. It utilizes the `pom.xml` file for configuration.

### MongoDB Dependency

To interact with MongoDB, the MongoDB dependency is added in the `pom.xml` file. This provides essential classes and methods for MongoDB integration, leveraging the Spring Boot ecosystem.

```

I will start by creating a User model class in the model package which will be used to store the user details in the database.

> **Note:** I will be using MongoDB as the database for this project.

## Repository

In the context of Java programming, a "repository" typically refers to a design pattern and structure used to manage and organize data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. It is often associated with the Model layer of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, or its variations like the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern.

Here's a breakdown of the components and concepts involved in a repository in Java:

- **Data Access and Storage**: A repository provides an abstraction for accessing and storing data. It shields the rest of the application from the complexities of data storage and retrieval mechanisms, such as databases, APIs, or files.
- **Data Management Methods**: The repository class typically exposes methods for common data operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (CRUD operations). These methods are responsible for interacting with the actual data storage mechanisms.
- **Encapsulation of Logic**: The repository encapsulates the logic required to interact with data sources. This separation of concerns improves code maintainability and scalability by isolating the data access code from the rest of the application's logic.
- **Data Model Mapping**: Repositories often map data models used within the application to the structures and formats used by the underlying data storage systems. This mapping ensures a clean separation between the application's data structures and the external data sources.
- **Caching and Optimization**: Depending on the implementation, repositories might also handle caching of frequently accessed data to improve performance. This can be particularly useful when dealing with expensive data retrieval operations.
- **Testing and Mocking**: Repositories make it easier to write unit tests for data-related functionality since they provide a clear boundary between the application and the data sources. Mocking or stubbing repository methods allows for controlled testing of different scenarios.
- **Dependency Injection**: Repositories are often used in conjunction with dependency injection frameworks. By injecting the repository interfaces into various parts of the application, you can achieve loose coupling and better separation of concerns.

### Here's a simple example of a repository interface in Java

```java
public interface UserRepository extends MongoRepository<User, String> {
    User findByEmail(String email);
    User findByUsername(String username);
}
```

### Explanation of the above code

- The `UserRepository` interface extends the `MongoRepository` interface, which is provided by Spring Data MongoDB. This interface provides methods for performing CRUD operations on a MongoDB database.
- It is a generic interface with two type parameters: the entity type and the ID type. In this case, the entity type is `User` and the ID type is `String`.
- We have also defined some custom methods in the `UserRepository` interface. These methods are used to perform custom queries on the database.
